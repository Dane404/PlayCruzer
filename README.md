# PlayCruzer - Project Description

## Static Part

### Introduction
Because there are already so many game-shops in the internet, we decided to highlight the advantages and disadvantages of them and compare them to each other on our static website to help our costumers to find the perfekt game-shop for their personal needs and wishes.
There are already plenty of website which compares movies or series based on the user friendliness and the offers. Due to the fact that the gaming branch is increasing, we would like to do the same with game shops to prevent transaktions in the wrong shop.

### Start Position 
#### What are we able to do?
* Every teammember is able to at least programm a simple html site with css.
#### What do we want to do?
* We want to improve our organisation ability to improve our teamwork. We also want that the abilitys of every teammember improves.
#### What are the deficits of the teammembers?
* The biggest deficit of the teammembers is disorganisation.

### General conditions and restrictions
Due to the Fact that this is a static website there are not that much restriction and we our website will be compatible with every operating system which is able to start a browser.
We also don´t need a budget, we just need to get the know- how to structure a website in order to increase the user-friendliness to the maximum. The only thing we need to get is the permission to use the names of the diffrent game-shops in positiv and negative aspects.
The deadline for our project is the 12th of February 2021, which is the end of the first school-semester.
Our comparissons will be on the grammatical standards of synchron and diachron comparissons.

### Project goals and system concepts
Our main goal is to develop a static website which is inexpanively developed, but has a high quality and a maximum user-friendlieness on modern standards of website development. 
Our vision is that gamers will use the static website to inform themselfs to prevent transaktions in the wrong shops and to inform themselfs about the USK. 

### Chances and risks
The chances are that the people will visit our website to inform themself about advantages and disadvantages of gameshops. The risks are that the people will ignore our site due to the fact that they have no interest in being informed about that topic.

## Web-Application Part

### Introduction
Because there are already so many watchlist for series and movies, we decided to create a Game-Watchlist(Playlist), because we didn´t find any of that kind. Our main goal is to maximise the user-friendlieness and the simpliness of the  website, because we don´t want the website to be to complicated.

### Start Position 
#### What are we able to do?
* Every teammember is able to at least programm a simple html site with css.
#### What do we want to do?
* We want to learn to program in java script and learn how to use an API, because if we learn this, we can develope a solid and clear website.
#### What are the deficits of the teammembers?
* The biggest deficit of the teammembers is disorganisation and the lack of knowledge in Java-script.

### General conditions and restrictions
Due to the fact that this is the dynamic website we need to try minimise the budget. We also need to request a permissions to use a API. 
This website will be compatible with every operating system which has the ability to use a web-browser. 
The deadline of our project is the 7th July 2021, which is the end of the school-year.


### Project goals and system concepts
Our main goal is to develop a website which has a account system and an list funktion, which records the played games and notes the games which are planned to play, of the user. We will try to keep the budget as low as possible and the quality and user-friendlieness as high as possible.
The reason we are making this website is, because we thought that the ideo of an game-watchlist is pretty nice and would help many people.
Our main target group are gamers which want to record their played games or to plan to play certain games.

### Chances and risks
The chances are that the users like the website and use our website regulary because of that. The risk are that people won´t like the design and the funktions and don´t use the website because of that.
