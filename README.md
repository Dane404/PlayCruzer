# PlayCruzer - Project Description
## Static Part
### Introduction
Because there are already so many game-shops in the internet, we decided to highlight the advantages and disadvantages of them and compare them to each other on our static website to help our costumers to find the perfekt game-shop for their personal needs and wishes.
There are already plenty of website which compares movies or series based on the user friendliness and the offers. Due to the fact that the gaming branch is increasing, we would like to do the same with game shops to prevent transaktions in the wrong shop.
### Start Position 

### General conditions and restrictions
Due to the Fact that this is a static website there are not that much restriction and we our website will be compatible with every operating system which is able to start a browser.
We also donÂ´t need a budget, we just need to get the know- how to structure a website in order to increase the user-friendliness to the maximum. The only thing we need to get is the permission to use the names of the diffrent game-shops in positiv and negative aspects.
The deadline for our project is the 12th of February 2021, which is the end of the first school-semester.
Our comparissons will be on the grammatical standards of synchron and diachron comparissons.

### Project goals and system concepts
Our main goal is to develop a static website which is inexpanively developed, but has a high quality and a maximum user-friendlieness on modern standards of website development. 
Our vision is that gamers will use the static website to inform themselfs to prevent transaktions in the wrong shops and to inform themselfs about the USK. 

### Chances and risks
The chances are that the people will visit our website to inform themself about advantages and disadvantages of gameshops. The risks are that the people will ignore our site due to the fact that they have no interest in being informed about that topic.
